Materials for an educational workflow for working with data generated by the National Estuarine Research Reserve's System-Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP)

This is currently a space for a web project that I am developing as an educational book for anyone interested in using SWMP data and applying many of the tools and R packages that have been developed (i.e., SWMPr, SWMPrExtension) to make the SWMP workflow easier. I plan to structure the book based on data type, purpose of use, and then types of analyses. 
This is building upon packages and work that several others have done, I am simply attempting to compile it all into an easy-to-digest manual for technicians within the program itself as well as anyone who uses the NERRS Centralized Data Management Office (CDMO)'s [data portal](https://cdmo.baruch.sc.edu/get/landing.cfm) to access and download SWMP data.
