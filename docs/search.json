    "text": "This is the website for “Working with SWMP Data Tools”. This book will teach you how to use a variety of tools in R to work with data generated by the National Estuarine Research Reserve’s System-Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP). I wrote it for anyone who has a familiarity with R programming, that may work within the NERRS system, or who uses the NERRS Centralized Data Management Office (CDMO)’s data portal to access and download SWMP data. Many of the packages and workflows presented in this book have been created by others and are cited wherever possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis book is a current work-in-progress. This material will reflect when a first edition of this work is finalized."
